\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular} { | m{4cm} | m{4cm} | m{4cm} | }
        \hline
        \empty & Microcontrollers (MCUs) & Digital Signal Processors\\
        \hline
        Functionality & General purpose, more suitable for sensing and control applications & More
        specialised, architecture and instruction set more suitable for signal processing\\
        \hline
        Power Consumption & Suitable for very low power applications & Typically run at full power\\
        \hline
        On-chip Peripherals & Typically have extensive inbuilt support & Most peripherals are not
        supoorted\\
        \hline
        Architecture & RISC-based with high performance extensions & Optimised instruction and
        architecture for executing repetitive algorithms\\
        \hline
        Ease of Use & Short development with good documentation and tools & Longer development time
        as there is more of an optimisation focus\\
        \hline
